# AutoInland-Vehicle-Insurance-Claim

### Data Description
The data describes ~ 12,000 policies sold by AutoInland for car insurance. Information on the car type, make, customer age and start of policy are in the data.

### Objective
The objective of this hackathon is to develop a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next three months. This solution will help streamline financial planning at AutoInland and allow them to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are likely to submit a claim.

### Metric for Success
1. Come up with a model that will be used to predict whether a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next 3 months.
2. Test the model using the confusion matrix and the accuracy test.
3. Predict the customers who will submit a vehicle insurance claim using the provided test dataset.
